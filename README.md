# Game Dev Template

This is a very early template of the current game. It includes the scene "Infinite" to show off the infinite procedural generation, and "Testing" for playing around with the first-person camera and player controller asset.
It includes the Synty Studios asset bundle included in Unity's student plan and the first-person and third-person assets created by Unity.
