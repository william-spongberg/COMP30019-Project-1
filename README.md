# Game Dev Template

This is a very early template of the current game. It includes the scene "Infinite" to show off the infinite procedural generation, and "Testing" for playing around with the first-person camera and player controller asset.
It includes the Synty Studios asset bundle included in Unity's student plan and the first-person and third-person assets created by Unity. Make sure to download and import the First Person assets from the Unity Asset Store if you run into any issues. Also download, import and initialise the Universal RP if you run into any issues with the shaders.

Clone this repo into your own branch before pushing any changes. This is to ensure that the dev branch stays stable and free of any bugs or issues.
